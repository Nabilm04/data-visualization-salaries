            <h2>Summary: What does this tell us?</h2>
            <p>
                Through this analysis of City-Parish salaries, we've uncovered a few trends in the data. 
                The average salary in this city is roughly $50,000 which is $13,795 less than the national average in the United States as of 2024.
                Though this is the case, the information is skewed because of the significant number of residents who have an income of 0.
                We've also uncovered that in that salary, hours don't have a strong impact on salary. 
                Which indicates there are other factors that contribute to salary. 
                One of which is years of service, there is a high reflection of the more years put in, the higher the salary. 
                Another one of which is pay location, there is a lot of variation between locations.
                Other than salary correlations, we've also uncovered hiring trends. 
                The data highlights that as time went on there is a decline in people being hired which could indicate different departmental initiatives or different payroll systems.
